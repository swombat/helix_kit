# Avatars

I want users to be able to upload a profile picture to their account.

AWS settings are already in the rails credentials under:

```yaml
aws:
  access_key_id: ...
  secret_access_key: ...
  s3_region: ...
  s3_bucket: ...
```

The bucket is already set up and credentials are correct. If somehow they don't work, please pause and ask for help during implementation.

The interface isn't rocket science... this is a very common functionality. I want this to be on the user settings page, at the top right of the card, above first/last name but alongside email. Show an avatar that's reasonably sized (about 40px circle), and allow the user to click to open a dialog to upload a new image or just delete the current one.

If there is no avatar set, show a placeholder which is the initials of the user's full name.

Of course the image should be stored on S3, and Rails should automatically resize the image to a reasonable size. In the detailed spec, please specify any gems we may need to install to make this work, if any are required.

No need at this point to enable drag and drop upload of the image, or resizing, just basic upload, unless this is super easy because of, e.g., a standard component or something.

I've installed the avatar and dialog shadcn components already.

There should be a route to get a specific user's avatar image, that should become part of the `as_json` when any user is rendered, so the frontend can always easily display the avatar.
