I need a way to add agents to an existing conversation.

Should be a button under the "..." on the right.

## Clarifications

- **Scope**: Group chats only — this feature is for adding agents to existing group chats (chats where `manual_responses` is already true). The existing "Assign to Agent" flow for non-group chats remains unchanged.
- **Add only**: No agent removal for now. Only adding new agents.
- **System message**: When an agent is added, create a visible system message (e.g., "Agent X joined the conversation").
- **Menu placement**: New "Add Agent" option appears in the "..." dropdown menu, but only for group chats. The existing "Assign to Agent" option continues to appear only for non-group chats.
