# IMPORTANT: Why this concern exists despite appearing to violate Rails conventions
#
# This concern solves a critical Rails limitation: as_json does NOT recursively call
# as_json on associated objects. When you define as_json on a model and include
# associations, Rails will serialize those associations using their default
# serialization, ignoring any custom as_json methods defined on those models.
#
# This breaks encapsulation and forces parent models to know about the internal
# serialization details of their associations. The JsonAttributes concern fixes this
# by ensuring that when associations are included in JSON serialization, they use
# their own json_attributes configuration.
#
# Example of the Rails limitation this solves:
#   class User < ApplicationRecord
#     def as_json(options = {})
#       super(only: [:id, :name])
#     end
#   end
#
#   class Account < ApplicationRecord
#     has_many :users
#     def as_json(options = {})
#       super(include: :users)  # Users will NOT use their custom as_json!
#     end
#   end
#
# With JsonAttributes, each model defines its own serialization once, and it works
# correctly when included as an association. This maintains proper encapsulation
# and follows the DRY principle better than Rails' default behavior.
#
# Yes, this adds metaprogramming complexity, but it's a necessary workaround for
# a design limitation in Rails that would otherwise lead to duplicated and
# fragile serialization logic scattered throughout the codebase.
