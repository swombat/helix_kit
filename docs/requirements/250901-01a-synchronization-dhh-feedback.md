# DHH-Style Review: Synchronization Requirements

## Overall Assessment

This synchronization design is headed in the right direction but suffers from premature abstraction and unnecessary complexity. While the concept of minimal broadcasts is sound, the implementation strays from Rails' fundamental principles of simplicity and convention. This feels like an over-engineered solution to what should be a straightforward problem solved with Rails' existing primitives.

## What's Good

- **Minimal broadcasts** - Broadcasting markers instead of full objects is smart. This aligns with Turbo's philosophy of sending minimal updates.
- **Leveraging Inertia's partial reloads** - Using the framework's built-in capabilities instead of reinventing the wheel.
- **Recognition that full page reloads are wasteful** - This shows good performance awareness.

## Critical Issues

### 1. Unnecessary Abstraction with `SyncRegistry`

Creating a new JavaScript class when ActionCable's consumer pattern already exists? This is exactly the kind of abstraction Rails developers should avoid. ActionCable already provides subscription management. Use it.

**Instead of:**
```javascript
let syncRegistry = new SyncRegistry();
syncRegistry.subscribe({...});
```

**Do this:**
```javascript
// Just use ActionCable directly
consumer.subscriptions.create({
  channel: "SyncChannel",
  account_id: selected_account?.id
}, {
  received(data) {
    router.reload({ only: [data.prop] })
  }
});
```

### 2. Fighting Rails Conventions

The three-tier subscription pattern (`Account:PNvAYr`, `Account:PNvAYr/account_users`, `Account:all`) adds complexity where Rails associations should suffice. 

Rails already knows these relationships. Use them:

```ruby
class Account < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :account_users
  
  # This is all you need
  after_update_commit do
    broadcast_refresh_to self
    broadcast_refresh_to :accounts if admin_watching?
  end
end
```

### 3. Manual Subscription Management

Requiring developers to manually track subscriptions in `onMount` and `onDestroy` violates the principle of convention over configuration. This boilerplate will be copy-pasted everywhere, creating maintenance headaches.

**Better approach:**
```svelte
<script>
  import { syncWith } from '$lib/sync';
  
  let { accounts = [], selected_account = null } = $props();
  
  // One line, done
  syncWith(selected_account);
</script>
```

### 4. Premature Optimization

The 300ms debouncing is premature optimization. Start simple. Add debouncing only when you have actual performance problems. YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It).

## The Rails Way Solution

Here's how this should be done, following Rails conventions:

### Rails Side

```ruby
# app/models/concerns/broadcastable.rb
module Broadcastable
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern
  
  included do
    after_commit :broadcast_refresh
  end
  
  private
  
  def broadcast_refresh
    # Use Turbo's built-in broadcasting
    broadcast_refresh_to self
  end
end

# app/models/account.rb
class Account < ApplicationRecord
  include Broadcastable
  
  # That's it. Rails handles the rest.
end
```

### Controller

```ruby
def index
  # Use Rails associations for authorization
  @accounts = current_user.admin? ? Account.all : current_user.accounts
  @selected_account = @accounts.find_by(id: params[:account_id])
  
  render inertia: "admin/accounts", props: {
    accounts: @accounts,
    selected_account: @selected_account
  }
end
```

### Frontend

```svelte
<script>
  import { page } from '@inertiajs/svelte';
  
  let { accounts = [], selected_account = null } = $props();
  
  // Turbo handles the streaming for us
  // No manual subscription management needed
</script>
```

## Key Principles Violated

1. **Convention over Configuration** - Too much manual setup required
2. **Fat Models, Skinny Everything Else** - Sync logic should live in models, not separate registry classes
3. **Don't Repeat Yourself** - The subscription boilerplate will be duplicated across pages
4. **YAGNI** - Debouncing, complex subscription patterns - all premature
5. **Use the Framework** - Rails and Turbo already solve these problems

## Specific Refactoring Suggestions

### 1. Eliminate the Registry

Use Rails' existing `broadcast_refreshes` pattern from Turbo. It's battle-tested and requires zero JavaScript code.

### 2. Simplify Authorization

```ruby
# Let Rails associations handle it
class AccountsChannel < ApplicationCable::Channel
  def subscribed
    account = current_user.accounts.find(params[:id])
    stream_for account
  rescue ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound
    reject
  end
end
```

### 3. Use Model Callbacks

```ruby
class Account < ApplicationRecord
  # Broadcast changes automatically
  after_update_commit -> { broadcast_replace_to self }
  after_destroy_commit -> { broadcast_remove_to self }
end
```

### 4. Leverage Stimulus for Any Custom Logic

If you absolutely need custom sync behavior:

```javascript
// app/frontend/controllers/sync_controller.js
import { Controller } from "@hotwired/stimulus"

export default class extends Controller {
  connect() {
    // Stimulus handles lifecycle automatically
    this.channel = consumer.subscriptions.create(...)
  }
  
  disconnect() {
    this.channel.unsubscribe()
  }
}
```

## The Minimal Solution

If you want to stick with Inertia instead of Turbo Frames, here's the absolute minimum:

```ruby
# Model
class Account < ApplicationRecord
  after_commit do
    ActionCable.server.broadcast "sync", { 
      model: self.class.name,
      id: id,
      action: destroyed? ? 'destroy' : 'update'
    }
  end
end

# Channel
class SyncChannel < ApplicationCable::Channel
  def subscribed
    stream_from "sync" if current_user
  end
end
```

```javascript
// Frontend
consumer.subscriptions.create("SyncChannel", {
  received(data) {
    // One line to refresh
    router.reload({ only: [data.model.toLowerCase() + 's'] })
  }
});
```

## Conclusion

This design shows good instincts about performance and user experience, but it's over-engineered. Rails already provides elegant solutions to these problems through ActionCable, Turbo, and model callbacks. 

The goal should be to write as little code as possible while achieving the desired functionality. Every line of code is a liability. Every abstraction is a potential source of bugs.

Remember: The best code is no code. The second best is Rails convention. Only when those fail should you build custom solutions.

**Final recommendation:** Use Turbo's `broadcast_refreshes` pattern. It's built for exactly this use case and requires almost no code. If you must use Inertia, keep the broadcasting logic in models and use ActionCable directly without wrapper abstractions.
