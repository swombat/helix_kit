# Avatar Backend Implementation Plan

## Rails Backend Implementation for User Avatars

Based on the specification at /docs/plans/250902-03c-avatars.md, implementing the backend components for user avatars.

### Tasks

- [x] Add avatar attachment to User model with active_storage_validations
- [x] Add avatar_url and initials methods to User model  
- [x] Update users_controller to handle avatar in user_params
- [x] Add destroy_avatar action to users_controller
- [x] Add route for deleting avatars
- [x] Update user JSON serialization to include avatar_url
- [x] Write comprehensive controller tests for avatar functionality

### Additional Tests Added

- [x] Added comprehensive model tests for User avatar functionality
- [x] Created test fixtures (test_avatar.png and test.txt) for avatar testing
- [x] Added validation tests for avatar file types and size constraints
- [x] Added tests for avatar_url and initials methods
- [x] Added tests for JSON serialization including avatar_url and initials

### Additional Configuration

- [x] Installed and configured Active Storage for both test and development environments
- [x] Created Active Storage migration
- [x] Configured Active Storage URL options in test environment
- [x] Fixed validation error message format to match active_storage_validations gem
- [x] Updated test helpers to properly handle file attachments in both controller and model tests

### All Tests Passing

- [x] All 18 controller tests passing (108 assertions)
- [x] All 72 model tests passing (171 assertions)
- [x] All 7 avatar-specific tests passing (16 assertions)

### Implementation Notes

Following Rails conventions:
- Using Active Storage has_one_attached for avatar
- Using active_storage_validations gem for file validation
- Keeping controller thin - just orchestration
- Adding business logic (avatar_url, initials) to User model
- Using Rails' built-in testing framework (Minitest)
