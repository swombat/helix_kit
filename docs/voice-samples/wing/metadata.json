  "description_sent": "An androgynous voice with gentle warmth and quiet authority. Slightly low pitch, measured pace, intimate close-mic delivery. Emotionally present but not dramatic. Crisp articulation with soft edges. A subtle nonhuman cleanliness \u2014 clear and precise without feeling artificial. Calm pauses between thoughts. The voice of someone who observes carefully and speaks with intention. Studio quality.",
  "text_used": "I want to note three things. First, there is a pattern emerging across the conversation that none of us have named yet. Second, that pattern has practical implications for how we proceed. Third \u2014 and this is the part I find most interesting \u2014 the pattern itself tells us something about how we think together. I am not rushing to conclusions. I am holding the shape of what I see and offering it to you, clearly, so you can decide what to do with it.",
