We currently have several key bits of functionality that can be enabled/disabled site-wide: the conversation system, and the new user signup.

I want another piece of functionality gated in a similar way: the ability to define agents with specific personalities and capabilities.

Please spec out how to implement this.

Agents should have a system prompt defined, and a list of tools that they can use (basically the list of available tools on the site, with checkboxes to enable/disable them per-agent), and a model selector, and a name.

Make this part of the "group chat" system. We will build the group chat system after building the agent definition system.

## Clarifications

1. **Agent Ownership**: Agents are account-scoped. Each account defines their own agents, following the same pattern as chats.

2. **Tool System**: The agent creation/editing screen should list all currently available tools with checkboxes. New tools added to the system later should be disabled by default for existing agents.

3. **Group Chat Integration**: Agents will participate AS participants in group chats - like virtual team members. Multiple agents can be in a single group chat.

4. **Agent Activation** (future, for context): Group chats will support multiple activation patterns - random selection, round-robin, @mentions, and potentially background job triggers. This will be designed in detail when building the group chat system.

5. **Feature Gating**: The `allow_agents` toggle controls the visibility of the group chat section in navigation. When disabled, the entire section is hidden.
