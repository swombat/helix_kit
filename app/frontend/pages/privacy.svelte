  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="text-muted-foreground">Last updated: February 1, 2026</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    HelixKit ("we", "us", or "our") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose,
    and safeguard your information when you use our application.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <h3>Account Information</h3>
  <p>When you create an account, we collect your name and email address.</p>

  <h3>Third-Party Integrations</h3>
  <p>
    If you choose to connect third-party services (such as Oura Ring), we collect and store data provided by those
    services, including health and wellness metrics such as sleep scores, readiness scores, and activity data. You can
    disconnect these integrations at any time, which will remove the associated data from our systems.
  </p>

  <h3>Usage Data</h3>
  <p>
    We collect information about how you interact with the application, including conversation history with AI agents
    and application settings.
  </p>

  <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>

    <li>Communicate with you about your account</li>

  <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>

    encrypted at rest. We use HTTPS for all data transmission.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    When you connect third-party services, their own privacy policies also apply to the data they collect. We encourage
    you to review the privacy policies of any third-party services you connect.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell your personal information. We may share data with third-party AI model providers to process your
    conversations. We do not share your health data with any third parties beyond what is necessary to provide the
    service.
  </p>

    <li>Export your data</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>

    integration, we remove the associated data from our systems.
  </p>
