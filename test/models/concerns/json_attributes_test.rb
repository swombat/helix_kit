# - Default method inclusion and boolean field conversion
# - Enhancement blocks with context propagation
# - Nested association handling with json_attributes inheritance
# - ID obfuscation behavior (documents current bug)
# - Option merging and runtime overrides
# - Real-world usage patterns with Account, User, and AccountUser models
