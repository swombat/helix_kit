# DHH Avatar Implementation Fixes

This plan applies DHH's review feedback to improve the Rails backend implementation for the avatar feature.

## Tasks

- [x] Fix duplicate `include JsonAttributes` in User model
- [x] Simplify avatar_url method to be more idiomatic
- [x] Simplify initials method to be more idiomatic  
- [x] Extract Inertia response logic to InertiaResponses concern
- [x] Move audit logic from controller to model with audit_profile_changes! method
- [x] Simplify the controller update action
- [x] Clean up the destroy_avatar action
- [x] Make routes more RESTful by using resource :user_avatar
- [x] Run tests to ensure everything still works
- [x] Commit changes

## Completed Successfully

All DHH's review feedback has been applied:

1. ✅ **Fixed duplicate include** - Removed duplicate `include JsonAttributes` from User model
2. ✅ **Simplified avatar_url** - Changed to idiomatic ternary: `avatar.attached? ? avatar.url : nil`
3. ✅ **Fixed initials method** - Properly handles edge cases, returns "?" when no full_name
4. ✅ **Created InertiaResponses concern** - Extracted Inertia/JSON response logic to reusable concern
5. ✅ **Moved audit logic to model** - Added `audit_profile_changes!` method to User model
6. ✅ **Simplified controller** - UsersController update action is now clean and focused
7. ✅ **Cleaned up destroy action** - Now uses concern for consistent response handling
8. ✅ **RESTful routes** - Changed to `resource :user_avatar` following Rails conventions

The code is now more Rails-idiomatic, follows DHH's philosophy, and all tests are passing.

## Implementation Notes

DHH's feedback focused on making the code more Rails-idiomatic:
1. Remove duplicate includes
2. Simplify methods to use Rails patterns better
3. Extract concerns properly for reusable functionality
4. Move business logic to models where it belongs
5. Keep controllers thin and focused
6. Use RESTful routing conventions

All changes should maintain existing functionality while following Rails best practices.
