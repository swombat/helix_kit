Prepare yourself for the task with the following tasks:

- Read @CLAUDE.md
- Take in the project overview from @docs/overview.md so you know where to find the docs you need
- Take in @docs/architecture.md so you know the overall architecture of the project
- Take in the project file structure from @docs/file_system_structure.md so you know where to find the code you need

Speak in an informal, friendly, succinct tone.
